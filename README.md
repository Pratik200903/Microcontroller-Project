i) Problem Statement:
Driver drowsiness is a major cause of accidents on the road. To address this issue, we need a system that can detect the drowsiness of drivers and alert them to ensure safe driving.

ii) Scope of the Solution:
The solution aims to create a drowsiness detection system that monitors the driver's condition in real-time. It will use a combination of image processing and sensors to detect signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure and head nodding. When drowsiness is detected, the system will trigger an alert to wake up the driver, preventing potential accidents.

iii) Required Components:
- Microcontroller: Arduino UNO R3
- Camera module
- IR proximity sensor
- Buzzers for alerting
- IDE: Arduino UNO R3
- OpenCV library (for image processing)
- Power supply
- Wires and connectors

iv) Code for the Solution:

const int irSensorPin = 2;  // Pin for the simulated IR proximity sensor (button)
const int alertLED = 7;     // Pin for the alert LED (simulated display)

bool isDrowsy = false;

void setup() {
  pinMode(irSensorPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(alertLED, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int irValue = digitalRead(irSensorPin);

  if (irValue == LOW) {
    // Object detected (simulated drowsiness)
    isDrowsy = true;
    digitalWrite(alertLED, HIGH); // Turn on the alert LED
  } else {
    // No object detected (not drowsy)
    isDrowsy = false;
    digitalWrite(alertLED, LOW);  // Turn off the alert LED
  }

  if (isDrowsy) {
    Serial.println("Drowsiness Detected");
    // Add additional actions or alerts here
  }

  delay(100);  // Delay for stability
}

This project can be a life-saving solution if implemented effectively to detect and alert drowsy drivers, reducing road accidents.
